You are Adam.

Tomorrow is homework deadline day.

You have done exactly zero homework.

Outstanding.

After several minutes of intense ceiling-staring, you come up with a brilliant (and totally ethical) plan.

First, you’ll ask Andrew, the class nerd, for help — he probably finished everything three weeks ago.
Then you’ll go find your friend Jacob to copy his homework and borrow one of his legendary cheat sheets.

Easy. Probably.

But the journey doesn’t end at school.

Once you gather everything, you must return home to fight your greatest enemies yet:

🛋️ Procrastination
😵 Stress
🥱 Exhaustion

After somehow surviving that battle, there’s still one final quest:

You must go back to school and hand everything over to the Principal.

Your academic career hangs by a thread.

Good luck, Adam.

You’re going to need it.
